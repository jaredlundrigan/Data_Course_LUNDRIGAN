My idea for a final project is to analyze Google search data about the 2022 midterm elections for the Senate and House. It would be an analysis of just the races that are toss ups. How I will gather my data will consist of 3-4 search terms/phrases using Google Trends. 

For example, the search volume for Ron Johnson and Mandela Barnes (Wisconsin). Google Trends uses values from 0 to 100 for the level of popularity. Another search phrase to analyze would be “Johnson Barnes Wisconsin” versus “Barnes Johnson Wisconsin” to analyze which name people type in Search first. Other search phrases would be “Johnson Mandela polls”, and “Johnson Mandela debate”.

The data would be collected for the 7 days leading up to election day for each state with close elections.

The goal of this project is to predict each Senate and House race that is close based on polls from FiveThirtyEight.
